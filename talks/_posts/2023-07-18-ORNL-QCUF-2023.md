## Abstract
Response functions are a fundamental aspect of physics; they represent the link between
experimental observations and the underlying quantum many-body state. However, this link is
often under-appreciated, as the Lehmann formalism for obtaining response functions in linear
response has no direct link to experiment. Within the context of quantum computing, and by
using a linear response framework, we restore this link by making the experiment an inextricable
part of the quantum simulation. This method can be frequency- and momentum-selective, avoids
limitations on operators that can be directly measured, and is ancilla-free. As prototypical
examples of response functions, we demonstrate that both bosonic and fermionic Greenâ€™s
functions can be obtained, and apply these ideas to the study of a charge-density-wave material
on ibm_auckland. The linear response method provides a robust framework for using quantum
computers to study systems in physics and chemistry. It also provides new paradigms for
computing response functions on classical computers.
