## Abstract
Quantum computing has the potential to help us overcome the barriers that are presented by the end of Mooreâ€™s law.  In the natural sciences, these barriers appear as limitations in computer memory and/or processing speed which prevent scientists from describing the problem fully and forcing them to work on smaller models or with approximate methods.  Since nature is fundamentally quantum, it is quite natural to view a quantum computer as a bespoke quantum simulator, where we can examine the open problems in science at a scale not possible with classical computers. In this talk, I will present how this is achieved, and discuss some of our recent work in this area.  I will outline how bringing the perspective of a condensed matter physicist into the realm of quantum information can help make quantum algorithms for simulation of many-body physics better, and even usable on today's quantum computers.
