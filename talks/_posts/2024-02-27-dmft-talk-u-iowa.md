## Abstract
Interesting problems in the field of condensed matter physics have greatly benefited from the development of computational algorithms alongside advancements in hardware to help solve many-body problems. Of these interesting problems, phase transitions due to quantum fluctuations continue to be an active area of research. The Mott metal-insulator transition can be observed using a numerical treatment called Dynamical Mean Field Theory, where the many-body interacting problem is mapped to an impurity model to alleviate some of the computational cost. While the exponentially scaling Hilbert space is still a formidable barrier, tools such as quantum subspace diagonalization and quantum computation provide new avenues to explore larger systems.
