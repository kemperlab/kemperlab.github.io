# Abstract
The measurement of quasiparticle scattering patterns on material surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is now an established technique for accessing the momentum-resolved electronic band structure of solids. However, since these quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns reflect spatial variations related to differences in the band momenta rather than the momenta themselves, their interpretation often relies on comparisons with simple geometrical models such as the joint density of states (JDOS) or with the convolution of Green’s functions.  In this paper, we highlight non-intuitive differences between Green’s function and JDOS results. To understand the origin of these discrepancies, we analyze the convolution of Green's functions using the Feynman parametrization technique and introduce a framework that we call the intermediate band analysis. This approach allows us to derive simple selection rules for interband QPI, based on electron group velocities. Connecting the intermediate band analysis with the experiment, we consider experimental Bogoliubov QPI patterns measured for $\FeSeS$, which were recently used to demonstrate a highly anisotropic superconducting gap, indicating superconductivity mediated by nematic fluctuations \cite{Nag2024}. The calculated Green's functions convolutions reproduce the particle-hole asymmetry in the intensity of QPI patterns across the Fermi level observed in experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of intermediate band analysis in tracing the origin of this asymmetry to a coherence factor effect of the superconducting state.
