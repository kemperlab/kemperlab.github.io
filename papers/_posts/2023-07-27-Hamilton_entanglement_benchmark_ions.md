# Abstract

We present proof of principle results for evaluating
an entanglement volumetric benchmark on trapped ion plat-
forms. The benchmark quantifies the robustness of multipartite
and bipartite entanglement using stabilizer measurements and
witness functions. Each n-qubit graph state is prepared and
used to evaluate n state-specific stabilizer strings. These stabilizer
measurements are used to evaluate entanglement witness func-
tions. The entanglement benchmark defines families of graph
states associated with an initial sub-graph of the hardware qubit
connectivity â€“ with all-to-all connectivity, trapped ion systems
provide a flexibility in the choice of this initial graph, and this
will affect the associated family. In this work we present results
targeting several classes of entangled states: 1)1-D cluster states,
2) n-qubit GHZ states, and 3) cycle graph states. These states have
been found in the literature as standard hardware benchmarks,
and have connections to many near-term applications.
