# Abstract
Identifying and studying the underlying two-electron interactions that give rise to emergent phenomena 
is a key step in developing a holistic understanding of quantum materials.  This step is hindered by the lack of
an experiment that can directly interrogate the interactions and the specific quasiparticles involved
in the interaction simultaneously.  We introduce correlation-ARPES (C-ARPES) as a new experimental
method that overcomes this difficulty and directly measures the interactions between specific, chosen quasiparticles
by measuring the correlations between two electrons photoemitted
from the same pulse (but not the same photon).  We illustrate how this technique can extract the underlying
interactions, and demonstrate this with an example of phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions, such as
those that give rise to charge density waves through the Kohn anomaly mechanism.
