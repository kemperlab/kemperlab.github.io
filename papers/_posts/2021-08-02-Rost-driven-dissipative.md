# Abstract
We study an open quantum system simulation on quantum hardware, which
demonstrates robustness to hardware errors even with deep circuits containing up
to two thousand entangling gates. We simulate two systems of electrons coupled
to an infinite thermal bath: 1) a system of dissipative free electrons in a driving
electric field; and 2) the thermalization of two interacting electrons in a single
orbital in a magnetic fieldâ€”the Hubbard atom. These problems are solved using
IBM quantum computers, showing no signs of decreasing fidelity at long times.
Our results demonstrate that algorithms for simulating open quantum systems
are able to far outperform similarly complex non-dissipative algorithms on noisy
hardware. Our two examples show promise that the driven-dissipative quantum
many-body problem can eventually be solved on quantum computers.
