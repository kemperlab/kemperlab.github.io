# Abstract
A new direction in quantum computing, which has traditionally  centered around the discrete variable paradigm, is the inclusion of continuous variable modes and the consideration of a hybrid continuous-discrete approach to quantum computing.  In this perspective paper, we discuss some of the advantages of this modality, and lay out a number of potential applications that can make use of it; these include applications from physics, chemistry, and computer science. We also briefly overview some of the algorithmic and software considerations for this new paradigm.
