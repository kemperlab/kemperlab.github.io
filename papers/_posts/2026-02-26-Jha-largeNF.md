# Abstract
The study of fermionic quantum field theories is an important problem for realizing the standard model of particle physics on a quantum computer. As a step towards this goal, 
we consider the massive Thirring and Gross--Neveu models with arbitrary number of fermion flavors, Nf, discretized on a spatial one-dimensional lattice of size L in the Hamiltonian formulation. We compute the gate complexity using the higher-order product formula and using block-encoding/qubitization and quantum singular value transformations in the limit of large Nf and L. We also prepare the ground states of both models with excellent fidelity for system sizes up to 20 qubits with Nf = 1,2,3,4 using the adaptive-variational quantum imaginary time algorithm. In addition, we also classify the dynamical Lie algebras of these relativistic fermionic models and show that they belong to the same isomorphism class. Our work is a concrete step towards the quantum simulation of real-time dynamics of large Nf fermionic quantum field theories models relevant for chiral symmetry breaking, understanding dimensional transmutation, and exploring the conformal window of field theories on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers.
