# Abstract
Recent improvements in the energy resolution of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering experiments (RIXS) at the Cu-L3 edge have enabled the study of lattice, spin, and charge excitations. Here, we report on the detection of a low intensity signal at 140meV, twice the energy of the bond-stretching (BS) phonon mode, in the cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (Bi-2212). Ultra-high resolution polarimetric RIXS measurements allow us to resolve the outgoing polarization of the signal and identify this feature as a two-phonon excitation. Further, we study the connection between the two-phonon mode and the BS one-phonon mode by constructing a joint density of states toy model that reproduces the key features of the data.
