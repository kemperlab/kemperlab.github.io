Jack Howard is an undergraduate physics and computer science double major in NC State’s class
of 2024. He joined the Kemper research group in 2022 with the goal of establishing rigorous,
open source software to interact with and run on quantum computers in order to aid the group’s
research interests. His research includes simplifying models of quantum interaction using
algebraic methods in order to improve the efficiency and feasibility of quantum computations.
Broader areas of his interest include machine learning techniques and other methods of
improving quantum circuits using topology and graph theory. In his free time, Jack enjoys a good
book, hike, or rock (for climbing), along with playing games and watching movies with friends.

Jack is now off to get his master's degree in CS.
