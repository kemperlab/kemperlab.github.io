I obtained my PhD from Syracuse University in 2019 and was postdoc at the
Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and Jefferson Lab before coming to NC State in
2025. My research covers topics in theoretical physics related to
quantum information and computation, lattice gauge theory, and tensor networks.
