Isaac received his bachelor's degrees in physics and mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in the spring of 2024. In the fall of that year he joined the physics PhD program at NC State, joining Kemper Lab in the summer of 2025. His interest in quantum computing originated during an undergraduate summer research project, during which he studied a quantum algorithm inspired by QAOA. He is currently working on Hamiltonian simulation in the context of hybrid continuous-variable discrete-variable (CV-DV) systems. Outside of physics, he enjoys playing marimba, playing guitar, cycling, and making small games in the Unity engine.
