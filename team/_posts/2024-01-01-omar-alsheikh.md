He then obtained his master’s degree from EPFL, Switzerland in 2021 with a specialization in particle physics theory. Omar joined the PhD program at NCSU and Kemper lab in fall 2023. His takes interest in the algebraic aspects of quantum computing and quantum algorithms. Currently he is working on Lie algebraic approaches to quantum simulation. Away from quantum computing and condensed matter, he is also interested in statistical modeling in biophysics, genetics, and ecology.
