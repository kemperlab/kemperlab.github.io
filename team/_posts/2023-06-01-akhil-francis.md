Akhil Francis is a graduate student who joined NC State in 2017. He started working in the group from the summer of 2018. Emergence of behavior resulting from interaction between many degrees of freedom is his motivation behind doing Condensed Matter physics. In order to compute quantities from many body interactions one needs efficient methods of computation. Quantum computing is a promising method to address the issue. Currently he is using Quantum Computation to study various lattice spin models. Also, has been working on how to use Monte Carlo techniques to compute real time quantities in condensed matter systems.

Akhil is now a postdoctoral scholar at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
